# Transportation Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Transportation Performance Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Excel** to monitor operational performance and extract business insights. The dashboard covers cost metrics, order activity, geographic performance, and trend analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze transportation-related data and build a dashboard that helps stakeholders:
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Understand monthly performance trends
- Identify cost drivers and efficiency metrics
- Compare performance across locations
- Detect potential anomalies (outliers)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel  
- Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Pivot Tables  
- Data Visualization (Charts)  
- Slicers (Filters)

---

## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Product Cost:** Total product-related cost during the analyzed period  
- **Count of Orders:** Total number of orders processed  
- **Income:** Total income/revenue generated  
- **Outliers:** Identified unusual or exceptional values/transactions  
- **Delivery Cost:** Total delivery/logistics cost  
- **Cost per Order:** Average cost per order  
  - **Formula:** (Product Cost + Delivery Cost) / Count of Orders

---

## 🔎 Key Analysis
- Monthly performance trend analysis  
- Cost structure (product vs delivery cost)  
- Regional performance comparison  
- Order volume insights  
- Outlier identification for further investigation

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Product cost is the major cost driver, indicating procurement/inventory decisions significantly affect overall cost efficiency.  
- Order activity varies by month, suggesting potential seasonality in transportation demand.  
- Regional performance differs across locations, highlighting strategic markets and improvement areas.  
- **Cost per Order (~$14,420)** provides a clear efficiency metric to track and optimize transportation operations.  
- Outliers may represent special cases or anomalies that require deeper investigation.
